# FEM-2D
This repository hosts the finite element numerical codes of some two-dimensional benchmarks, completed as a part of the course 
course 651-4144-00L [__Introduction to Finite Element Modelling in Geosciences__](http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~gfdteaching/femblockcourse/2019/) during the Spring semester 2019 at ETH Zurich.

**Contents**
- Transient diffusion equation (heat conduction) 
- Elasticity equation (solid mechanics)
- Dam break flow (stokes flow)
- Viscous fingering in porous media (darcy and advection-diffusion equations) 
- Code verification employing the method of manufactured solutions and computing the order of accuracy
